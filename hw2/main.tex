% Task 1 (4 points) Let Σ = {a, b}. Investigate the following two languages on whether they are
% DFA languages or not. Prove your answers!
% 1. (2 points) L1 = { w ∈ Σ
% ∗
% | #a(w) mod 2 = #b(w) mod 2 }
% 2. (2 points) L2 = { w ∈ Σ
% ∗
% | #a(w) mod k = #b(w) mod ` },
% where k and ` are some fixed given natural numbers bigger than 1 (imagine, say, k = 3
% and ` = 5.)
% Here #x(w) for x ∈ Σ and w ∈ Σ
% ? denotes the number of occurences of the letter x in w.
% Task 2 (4 points) Let Σ = {0, 1}. For x = xn−1xn−2 · · · x1x0 let hxi2 =
% P
% 0≤i<n xi2
% i be the number
% denoted by string x in the binary system. Investigate the following two languages on whether
% they are DFA languages or not. Prove your answers!
% 1. (2 points) L3 = { x ∈ Σ
% ∗
% | hxi2 mod 3 = 0 }
% 2. (2 points) L4 = { x ∈ Σ
% ∗
% | hxi2 is not a perfect square }
% Task 3 (6 points) Let Σ = {a, b}.
% 1. (2 points) Design an NFA that accepts exactly all words in Σ
% ∗
% for which the 3rd-last
% letter is an a. Try to make your NFA have few states.
% 2. (2 points) Design a DFA that accepts exactly all words in Σ
% ∗
% for which the 3rd-last
% letter is an a. Try to make your DFA have few states.
% 3. (2 points) If “4th-last” were replaced by “kth-last” for some fixed integer k ≥ 1, how
% would your constructions from the parts above and corresponding numbers of states
% change (no proof needed)?
% Task 4 (2 points)
% Design a DFA that recognizes the language
% S = { a
% n
% | n > 1600 and n is a leap year in the Gregorian Calendar }.

\section*{Problem 3}

\subsection*{(1.)}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

So in this NFA we can have arbitraryly many a's and b's before the third last a, then we have to read an a, then we can read an a or b, then we can read an a or b and then we reach the final state.
I named the states as 0, 1, 2, 3. They are just dummy names. Here 3 is the starting state and 0 is the final state.

\subsection*{(2.)}

(plaese look at figure 2. for some reason the image goes to the end of the paper :))
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{3_dfa.jpeg}
  \caption{dfa}
\end{figure}
This is the DFA version of the NFA above. The state names in DFA correspond to the NFA states they contain. The state \(\{3\}\) is the starting state
and the states \(\{0, 3\}, \{0,2,3\}, \{0,1,3\}, \{0,1,2,3\}\) are the final states. I constructed this DFA from the NFA above using the strategy we learned in the lecture.

\subsection*{(3.)}

We can see the NFA in two parts the starting state and the chain of states after that (the last node of the chain being the final state). If we were to change 3rd last to kth last
then in the chain part of the NFA we would simply have k states instead of 3 states. And from the NFA we would reconstruct the DFA.

\section*{Problem 4}

(plaese look at figure 3. for some reason the image goes to the end of the paper :))
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4.jpeg}
  \caption{leap year dfa}
\end{figure}

We can design a DFA with 2000 states. The first 1600 states will be just a chain of states from 0 to 1599. After that we have a looping 400 states where leap years are final states.
The chain part is for "\(>\) 1600" condition in the question. And the looping 400 states part is for detecting the leap years.
